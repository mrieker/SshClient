        <P>A basic SSH Client that can be used to access remote computers that are accessible via SSH.  Unlike some
            other Android SSH Clients, this one only requires internet access permission to make SSH connections and
            write external storage permission for the file transfer functions.</P>
        <P>
            There are six screens:
            <UL>
                <LI><B><A HREF="shell.html">SHELL</A></B> - contains the currently selected session's contents, consisting
                    of a connect-to single-line text box and a large screen text box.  This is the screen you are
                    usually on when communicating with a remote host.</LI>
                <LI><B><A HREF="filetransfer.html">FILE TRANSFER</A></B> - lists the directory you are currently pointed
                    to, either on the remote host or on the local device.</LI>
                <LI><B><A HREF="tunnels.html">TUNNELS</A></B> - lists the defined tunnels for the current session and
                    provides a method to define new ones, and open, close, delete existing ones.</LI>
                <LI><B><A HREF="settings.html">SETTINGS</A></B> - this has various settings that you can adjust as you
                    like.</LI>
                <LI><B><A HREF="vncclient.html">VNC CLIENT</A></B> - accesses a VNC server located on a server connected
                    to by the current session.</LI>
                <LI><B><A HREF="#HELP">HELP</A></B> - this screen.</LI>
            </UL>
            You can navigate to the desired screen by clicking the Android's menu button then clicking <B>More</B> and then
            selecting the screen you want.
