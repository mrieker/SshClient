/**
 * This thread copies characters from the remote host and
 * queues them to be displayed in the scrolled text window.
 * It lives on as part of JSessionService even when the GUI
 * is detached, so as to keep the connection alive and pass
 * on data to ScreenTextBuffer.
 *
 * JSessionService holds these in memory.
 *
 * These in turn hold the jsession (TCP connection) in memory.
 *
 * These also hold the corresponding ScreenTextBuffer in memory
 * so there is someplace to put incoming host data.
 *
 * When the GUI is detached, it is detached from ScreenTextBuffer,
 * so it should be garbage collected.
 *
 * THe only other thing these should point to are the detstate
 * hash maps which just have primitives in them describing the
 * GUI state (high level) so it can be restored.
 *
 * Note that this thread doesn't actually have to be running to
 * fulfill its function of keeping the jsession alive, in the
 * case where it is just being used for sftp or tunnelling.  It
 * will be running only if the connection is being used for shell
 * access.
